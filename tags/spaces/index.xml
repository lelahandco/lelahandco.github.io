      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do this things in the morning sometimes where I walk around my neighborhood park and act like I&amp;rsquo;m a curious and eager kid in a very old and slow body. I look, feel, smell, etc. It grounds me, gets me in a curious and at the same time slows me down. It&amp;rsquo;s wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today the park gifted me a whole bunch of snails. Some making a long track over the stone path, others having climbed high in a berry bush eating the meal of a lifetime I imagine. (Un)fortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t have my phone to take a picture, so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to trust me that they were really really cute. I even got to see insides of one of the sail when I looked close enough.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During another algorithmically cultivated stroll around the internet I came across a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdj14_jdumI&amp;amp;start=4639&#34;&gt;yt video by Pagemelt&lt;/a&gt;  that&amp;rsquo;s about algorithms and what they do to us as humans. And towards the end Pagemelt says something I feel like I profoundly relate to. It is that when i reach for something to scroll (yt, instagram, etc) that I do this most likely because I&amp;rsquo;m feeling lonely. Not the kind of lonely where i have no-one to talk to, but the one where I&amp;rsquo;d just love to be in a space with people around living their life, doing things, whatever that may be. I wonder what kind of spaces I have in my life that are like that, and if there are new shared spaces I can discover or create myself&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
