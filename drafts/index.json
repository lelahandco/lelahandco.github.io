It is that when i reach for something to scroll (yt, instagram, etc) that I do this most likely because I\u0026rsquo;m feeling lonely. Not the kind of lonely where i have no-one to talk to, but the one where I\u0026rsquo;d just love to be in a space with people around living their life, doing things, whatever that may be. I wonder what kind of spaces I have in my life that are like that, and if there are new shared spaces I can discover or create myself.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":""}]
