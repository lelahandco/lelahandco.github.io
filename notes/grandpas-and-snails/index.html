  <meta name="description" content="I do this things in the morning sometimes where I walk around my neighborhood park and act like I’m a curious and eager kid in a very old and slow body.

Today the park gifted me a whole bunch of snails. Some making a long track over the stone path, others having climbed high in a berry bush eating the meal of a lifetime I imagine. (Un)fortunately I didn’t have my phone to take a picture, so you’ll have to trust me that they were really really cute. I even got to see insides of one of the sail when I looked close enough." />
