<p>Play, to me, is giving one&rsquo;s attention to this master of fleetness, this priest of change, the subconscious imaginative mind. Watching childeren play prentend, I can&rsquo;t help but notice the ways one thing flows into the next seemingly without any second thought. The moment one is forced to stand still, reconsider their subconcious playfulness, play is thrown out the mind&rsquo;s window. Only when the the imagination is given free rein is play at it&rsquo;s best. Therefore, play is the relishing in the reality of the everchanging.</p>
<p>I think games act like a guide to giving attention to this subconscious. It is scary, the fleeting, the playfulness. We, most adults, maybe out of need or maybe out of whatever society is, learn to keep things as they are. Fear is looking away from reality, holding tight to what we have. By doing so we are trying to swim upstream, as reality can not help itself but change. Games give a kind of permission to play in a controlled environment. They tell the player they are free to let their imagination go, but not too far. You could say that we train ourselves to enjoy this everchanging reality in games.</p>

<p>When saying &ldquo;attention to the subconscious&rdquo; I had to ask myself what I believe attention actually is. This is what I came up with: Anything I&rsquo;ve ever experienced and any person I&rsquo;ve met I carry in me. The way I think, talk, act is all because of the cumulation my experiences (possibly in combination with traits I was born with). This may be the Self. Attention, to me, is the conscious allowing something to become part of that Self. Choice and conscience are tricky subjects, but possibly: without attention there is personal choice in the forming of the self.</p>
<p>Should we choose to play? Then we allow the everchanging subconscious (imagionation) to become part of the self. And, in this everchanging reality this might be the closest we get to feel the <span class="sidenote">
  <input
    aria-label="Show sidenote"
    type="checkbox"
    id="sidenote-checkbox-01"

  />
  <label
    tabindex="0"
    role="mark"
    aria-details="sidenote-01"
    for="sidenote-checkbox-01"

    <span class="sr-only"> (sidenote: </span>I experience a lot of meaning in play because, I think, of this<span class="sr-only">)</span>
  </small>
</span>
 . It&rsquo;s a way of letting go. Holding things not in a closed fist, but an open hand. Not owning but admiring.</p>
<p>PS: Sometimes I feel like a mad scientist asking questions like this, but damn if it isn&rsquo;t fun! Looking forward to revisiting these ideas sometime, as they are everychanging ;P</p>
